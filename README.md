OceanFirst Film Screening Festival

# project overview

This website depicts what it would look like to host a film festival at the California Academy of Sciences that has a focus on ocean conservation and climate change awareness. While it is not a real event, the schedule, location, prices, and all other details have been planned out as if it is. The made-up brand, OceanFirst, has branding seamlessly based off of Oceana, a real-world organization with emphasis on the ocean, and would raise money for their cause if it were to happen. The OceanFirst site acts as a guide for anyone who would be looking to attend this event, providing all the necessary information in an organized fashion and linking out to important resources.
